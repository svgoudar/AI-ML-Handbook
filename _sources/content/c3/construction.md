# Construction

In this section, we construct the three classifiers covered in the previous section. Binary and multiclass {doc}`logistic regression <s2/logistic_regression>` are covered first, followed by the {doc}`perceptron algorithm <s2/perceptron>`, and finally {doc}`Fisher's linear discriminant <s2/fisher_discriminant>`.
