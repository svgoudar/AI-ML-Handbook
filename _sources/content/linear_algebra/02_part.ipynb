    "### Scalar\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:** A scalar is a **single numerical value** that represents only **magnitude** (no direction).\n",
    "* **Examples (Physics/Everyday life):** Speed = 45 km/h, Temperature = 25°C.\n",
    "* **Applications in Data Science:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Count of records in a dataset (e.g., total = 5).\n",
    "  * Mean/average of a feature (e.g., average age).\n",
    "  * Intercept term **c** in Linear Regression (**y = mx + c**) is a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition (Physics):** Numerical value with **magnitude + direction**.\n",
    "* **Definition (Data Science):** An **ordered list of numbers** representing a point in space or a quantity.\n",
    "* **Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Physics: Car speed = 45 km/h east (magnitude + direction).\n",
    "  * Data Science: Student record → (IQ=90, Study hours=3).\n",
    "  * Person’s weight over months → (70, 72, 75, 73).\n",
    "* **Geometric Representation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 2D vector → (x, y) point in coordinate space.\n",
    "  * Distance from origin calculated using **Pythagoras theorem**.\n",
    "  * Extended to 3D (x, y, z) and higher dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications in Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Representation:** Each record = a vector of features (F1, F2, F3...).\n",
    "* **Visualization:** In 2D/3D, vectors represent features like IQ vs Study Hours.\n",
    "* **Classification Example:** Logistic Regression separates vectors (records) into regions (Pass/Fail) using a line (**y = mx + c**).\n",
    "* **High Dimensions:** Data may exist in thousands of dimensions, but linear algebra supports computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unit Vector:** A vector with magnitude = 1, represented as î (x-axis), ĵ (y-axis).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Example: (3,3) = 3î + 3ĵ.\n",
    "* **Vector Property:** Same direction & length remain constant even if the origin changes.\n",
    "* **Real-World Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Gaming (GTA):** Cars moving with speed and direction (vectors). Collision effects are computed using vector math.\n",
    "  * **Boat vs Waves:** Direction and speed of vectors determine boat’s movement and effect of waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Key Takeaway:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scalars = magnitude only.**\n",
    "* **Vectors = magnitude + direction (or ordered list of values).**\n",
    "* In **Data Science**, every data point is a **vector**, making linear algebra essential for machine learning, regression, classification, and deep learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "    * $p_1 = (-4, 3)$, $p_2 = (5, 3)$\n",

    "* **Geometric Interpretation:** Moving along one vector and then another shifts the final position to the sum vector.\n",

    "\n",
    "   * **Word Embeddings:** Words are represented as vectors.\n",
    "   * Combining vectors (e.g., “data” + “science”) creates a new embedding for the combined phrase.\n",
    "   * Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * \"data\" = (0.2, 0.1, 0.4), \"science\" = (0.3, 0.7, 0.2)\n",
    "     * \"data science\" = (0.5, 0.8, 0.6).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Image Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Colored images use RGB channels (vectors).\n",
    "   * Converting to grayscale involves adding R, G, and B values and taking the average.\n",
    "   * Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Red = (255, 128, 0), Green = (128, 255, 0), Blue = (64, 64, 255).\n",
