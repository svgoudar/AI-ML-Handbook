    "Linear algebra is the backbone of **data representation** in Data Science, where datasets are stored as vectors and matrices.\n",
    "It powers **machine learning algorithms** like regression, PCA (dimensionality reduction), and deep learning through matrix multiplications and transformations.\n",
    "In essence, linear algebra provides the mathematical tools that make large-scale **data processing and model building** possible.\n"
