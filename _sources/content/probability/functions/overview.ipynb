    "## Probability Functions Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability functions describe how probabilities are assigned to outcomes of random variables. Depending on whether the variable is **discrete** or **continuous**, we use different functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Probability Distribution Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **probability distribution function** tells us how the probabilities of different outcomes are spread across the possible values of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It answers:\n",
    "‚û°Ô∏è *‚ÄúIf I pick a value of this random variable, what is the chance it occurs?‚Äù*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types depending on whether the variable is **discrete** or **continuous**:\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Discrete Random Variables ‚Üí *Probability Mass Function (PMF)*\n",
    "\n",
    "* Used when outcomes are **countable** (like rolling a die or flipping a coin).\n",
    "* PMF gives the probability of each exact value.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Continuous Random Variables ‚Üí *Probability Density Function (PDF)*\n",
    "\n",
    "* Used when outcomes can take **any value in a range** (like height, weight, or time).\n",
    "* PDF doesn‚Äôt give probabilities directly; instead, **areas under the curve** represent probabilities.\n",
