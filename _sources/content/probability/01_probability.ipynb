    "## What is Probability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability theory is the mathematical framework for quantifying uncertainty. It allows us to make informed decisions and predictions in situations where outcomes are not predetermined.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample Space\n",
    "\n",
    "- **($\\Omega$ or S) - *A Universe of Possibilities***\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample space is the foundational concept. It's the complete, exhaustive, and mutually exclusive set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. Think of it as the \"universe\" for that particular experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Characteristics of a Sample Space:**\n",
    "    * **Exhaustive:** It must include every single possible outcome. Nothing can be left out.\n",
    "    * **Mutually Exclusive:** No two outcomes in the sample space can occur at the same time. If one outcome happens, all others in the sample space are automatically excluded.\n",
    "    * **Properly Defined:** The outcomes should be distinct and unambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Types of Sample Spaces:**\n",
    "    * **Discrete Sample Space:** The outcomes are countable, often finite, or countably infinite (like the set of positive integers).\n",
    "        * *Example:* Number of heads in 3 coin flips: $\\Omega = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$ (Finite)\n",
    "        * *Example:* Number of flips until the first head: $\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$ (Countably infinite)\n",
    "    * **Continuous Sample Space:** The outcomes can take any value within a given range (an interval). These are typically uncountable.\n",
    "        * *Example:* The exact temperature of a room: $\\Omega = \\{x \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}, x > 0\\}$ (or a specific range like $[15^\\circ C, 30^\\circ C]$)\n",
    "        * *Example:* The height of a randomly selected person.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Importance:** A clearly defined sample space is crucial because all probability calculations are based on it. If you miss an outcome, your probabilities will be incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Events (E) \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Specific Subsets of Outcomes**\n",
    "\n",
    "An event is a subset of the sample space. It's a collection of one or more outcomes that we are interested in. Events are often denoted by capital letters like A, B, C.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Types of Events:**\n",
    "    * **Simple Event (Elementary Event):** An event consisting of exactly one outcome from the sample space.\n",
    "        * *Example:* Rolling a die and getting a 3. $E = \\{3\\}$\n",
    "    * **Compound Event:** An event consisting of two or more outcomes from the sample space.\n",
    "        * *Example:* Rolling a die and getting an even number. $E = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$\n",
    "    * **Certain Event:** An event that is guaranteed to happen. It is equal to the sample space itself. $P(\\text{Certain Event}) = 1$.\n",
    "        * *Example:* Rolling a die and getting a number less than 7. $E = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} = \\Omega$.\n",
    "    * **Impossible Event:** An event that cannot happen. It is represented by an empty set ($\\emptyset$). $P(\\text{Impossible Event}) = 0$.\n",
    "        * *Example:* Rolling a die and getting a 7. $E = \\{\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Operations on Events:**\n",
    "    * **Union ($A \\cup B$):** Occurs if event A *or* event B (or both) occur.\n",
    "    * **Intersection ($A \\cap B$):** Occurs if event A *and* event B both occur.\n",
    "    * **Complement ($A^c$ or $A'$):** Occurs if event A *does not* occur. (As explained in the previous response).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Counting Principles \n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Art of Enumeration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before calculating probabilities, we often need to know \"how many\" possible outcomes or favorable outcomes exist. This is where counting principles come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Permutations - *Order Matters!*\n",
    "\n",
    "A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific sequence. The key differentiator is that changing the order creates a *new* permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **When to use:** When you are arranging items, assigning positions, or when the sequence of selection is important.\n",
    "* **Formula for Permutations of n objects taken r at a time:**\n",
    "    $P(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$\n",
    "    Where:\n",
    "    * $n$: total number of distinct objects available.\n",
    "    * $r$: number of objects being selected and arranged.\n",
    "    * $n!$ (n factorial) is $n \\times (n-1) \\times (n-2) \\times \\dots \\times 2 \\times 1$. $0! = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Deeper Example:** How many ways can 4 different books be arranged on a shelf?\n",
    "    * n = 4 (total books)\n",
    "    * r = 4 (all books are being arranged)\n",
    "    * $P(4, 4) = \\frac{4!}{(4-4)!} = \\frac{4!}{0!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{1} = 24$ ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Permutations with Repetition:** If you have repeated items, the formula changes. For example, for the word \"MISSISSIPPI\", you'd account for repeated 'S', 'I', 'P'.\n",
    "    * Formula for n objects with $n_1$ identical objects of type 1, $n_2$ identical objects of type 2, etc.: $\\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\\dots n_k!}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combinations \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Order Doesn't Matter!**\n",
    "\n",
    "A combination is a selection of objects where the order of selection does not matter. It's about forming groups or subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **When to use:** When you are choosing a committee, picking lottery numbers, or selecting a group where the sequence of selection doesn't create a new outcome.\n",
    "* **Formula for Combinations of n objects taken r at a time:**\n",
    "    $C(n, r) = \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$\n",
    "    * This formula effectively divides the number of permutations by $r!$ to remove the orderings within each group of $r$ objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Deeper Example:** You have 10 friends, and you want to invite 3 of them to a dinner party. How many different groups of 3 friends can you invite?\n",
    "    * n = 10 (total friends)\n",
    "    * r = 3 (friends to invite)\n",
    "    * Order doesn't matter (inviting A, B, C is the same as inviting B, A, C).\n",
    "    * $C(10, 3) = \\frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = \\frac{10!}{3!7!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7!}{ (3 \\times 2 \\times 1) \\times 7!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{720}{6} = 120$ groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Key Distinction between Permutations and Combinations:**\n",
    "    * **Permutation:** Choosing a president, vice-president, and secretary from 10 people (order matters).\n",
    "    * **Combination:** Choosing a committee of 3 people from 10 people (order doesn't matter).\n"
