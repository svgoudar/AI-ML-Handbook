    "Probability distributions describe how the values of a random variable are spread or distributed.  \n",
    "They provide a mathematical framework to model uncertainty and make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributions are broadly classified into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Discrete Probability Distributions** → For variables that take **countable outcomes** (e.g., coin toss, number of defects).  \n",
    "- **Continuous Probability Distributions** → For variables that take **any value within an interval** (e.g., height, weight, time).\n",
