# Discrete Probability Distributions

A **discrete probability distribution** describes the probabilities of outcomes of a *discrete random variable* — one that takes only **countable values** (finite or infinite).  
Examples: number of coin tosses until heads, number of emails in an hour, or dice outcomes.

Key properties:  
- The probability of each outcome is **between 0 and 1**.  
- The sum of all probabilities equals **1**.  

Common discrete distributions include:
- **Bernoulli Distribution** – models a single trial with success/failure.  
- **Binomial Distribution** – number of successes in multiple independent trials.  
- **Poisson Distribution** – counts of events occurring in a fixed interval.  
- **Geometric & Negative Binomial Distributions** – number of trials until success.  
- **Discrete Uniform Distribution** – equally likely outcomes.
