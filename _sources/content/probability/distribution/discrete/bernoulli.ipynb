    "The **Bernoulli Distribution** is the simplest discrete probability distribution, used to model random experiments with exactly **two possible outcomes**â€”commonly called **success** (with probability \\$p\\$) and **failure** (with probability \\$1-p\\$, or \\$q\\$).\n",

    "* **Binary Outcomes:** Each trial results in either \\$1\\$ (success) or \\$0\\$ (failure). Examples include flipping a coin (heads/tails) or passing/failing a test.\n",
