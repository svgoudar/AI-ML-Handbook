# Continuous Probability Distributions

A **continuous probability distribution** describes outcomes of a *continuous random variable* — one that can take **any value within an interval**.  
Examples: height, weight, temperature, or time.

Key properties:  
- The probability of any **exact value** is 0.  
- Probabilities are defined over an **interval** using the **area under the curve** of the probability density function (PDF).  
- The total area under the PDF equals **1**.  

Common continuous distributions include:
- **Normal (Gaussian) Distribution** – bell-shaped, most widely used.  
- **Exponential Distribution** – models waiting times between events.  
- **Uniform Distribution** – equal probability across an interval.  
- **Gamma Distribution** – models skewed data, often for waiting times.  
- **Beta Distribution** – useful for proportions and probabilities.  
- **Chi-Square & t-Distributions** – important in hypothesis testing.
