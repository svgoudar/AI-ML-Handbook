    "   * In the population variance, we subtract $\\mu$ (true mean).\n",
    "   * In the sample variance, we subtract $\\bar{x}$ (sample mean), which itself is **estimated from the data**.\n",
    "   * This makes the deviations “slightly smaller” than they should be → underestimation of variance.\n",

    "2. **Correction for Underestimation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If we divide by $n$, we get a **biased (systematically too small)** estimate of the true variance.\n",
    "   * Dividing by $n-1$ makes the estimator **unbiased** — on average across repeated sampling, it matches the true variance.\n",

    "3. **Degrees of Freedom (DoF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * When computing variance, **one degree of freedom is lost** because the sample mean $\\bar{x}$ is already “fixed” from the data.\n",
    "   * Hence, only $n-1$ values are “free to vary.”\n",
