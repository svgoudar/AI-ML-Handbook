    "## ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ANOVA** is a statistical method used to **compare the means of two or more groups**.\n",
    "* If only two groups → t-test or z-test is usually applied.\n",
    "* If **three or more groups** → ANOVA is more suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Why Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Widely used in **data analysis** and **data science**.\n",
    "* Helps test whether differences among group means are statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Key Components of ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Factors**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A factor is a variable under study.\n",
    "   * Example: *Medicine type* or *Mode of payment*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Levels**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Different categories/values within a factor.\n",
    "   * Example (Medicine factor): Dosages like **5mg, 10mg, 15mg**.\n",
    "   * Example (Mode of payment factor): **Google Pay, PhonePe, IMPS, NEFT, DD**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Factor & Levels Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Medicine** → Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Levels → Dosage (5mg, 10mg, 15mg).\n",
    "* **Mode of Payment** → Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Levels → UPI, IMPS, NEFT, Demand Draft, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What’s Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "* In future lessons → discuss **independent vs. dependent factors**, **assumptions of ANOVA**, and **types of ANOVA** (One-way, Two-way, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Takeaway**:\n",
    "ANOVA is used to compare group means when there are **two or more groups**, and it works with **factors (variables)** that have multiple **levels (categories/values)**.\n",

    "### Assumptions of ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "To use **ANOVA** correctly, certain assumptions must be satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normality of Sampling Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **sampling distribution of the mean** should be **normally distributed**.\n",
    "* This comes from the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**.\n",
    "* In simple terms: group means should follow a **Gaussian distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Absence of Outliers**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data should be **free from extreme outliers**, as they can distort results.\n",
    "* Outliers must be detected and removed using methods like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Boxplot / IQR method**\n",
    "  * **Z-score filtering**\n",
    "  * Other feature engineering techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Homogeneity of Variance (Equal Variances)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variances across groups (levels of independent variables) must be **equal**.\n",
    "* Example notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\sigma_1^2 = \\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma_3^2\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "* This ensures that group comparisons are fair.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Independence & Random Sampling**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Samples must be:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Independent** (one observation does not influence another).\n",
    "  * **Randomly selected** (to avoid bias).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Takeaway**:\n",
    "ANOVA works reliably only when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Group means are normally distributed.\n",
    "* No outliers distort the data.\n",
    "* Variances across groups are equal.\n",
    "* Samples are independent and randomly drawn.\n",
