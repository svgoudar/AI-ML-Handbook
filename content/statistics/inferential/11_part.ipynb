    "#  Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> When we take repeated random samples from a population and calculate their means, the distribution of these sample means will **approximate a normal distribution (bell curve)** — regardless of the shape of the original population distribution — **if the sample size is large enough (n ≥ 30 is a common rule of thumb).**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Works even if the population distribution is **not normal** (e.g., skewed, uniform).\n",
    "2. The **larger the sample size (n)** → the closer the sample mean distribution is to a **normal distribution**.\n",
    "3. The **mean of the sample means** = the **population mean (μ)**.\n",
    "4. The **spread of sample means** is smaller than population spread, and is given by the **Standard Error (SE):**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "SE = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\sigma$ = population standard deviation\n",
    "* $n$ = sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Why It’s Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "* It allows us to **use normal distribution methods** (Z-test, t-test, ANOVA) even when the population is not normal.\n",
    "* It is the **foundation of inferential statistics** → helps us make conclusions about populations from samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Example\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suppose exam scores in a college are **right-skewed** (most students score low, a few very high).\n",
    "* If we randomly take small samples (say 5 students each), their average will still look skewed.\n",
    "* But if we take **many larger samples (say n = 50 students each)** and plot the means → the distribution of those means will look **normal (bell curve)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Population distribution → could be skewed, uniform, exponential, etc.\n",
    "⬇️\n",
    "Take many random samples (n ≥ 30) and calculate means.\n",
    "⬇️\n",
    "Distribution of sample means → looks **normal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **In short:**\n",
    "Even if your data is not normal, **the averages of sufficiently large samples will be normal.**\n",
    "This is why **ANOVA, t-tests, Z-tests** rely on the CLT assumption of normality of sampling distribution.\n",

    "  * Factor = Running\n",
    "  * Levels = Days (dependent, since same participants measured repeatedly)\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Factors**: ≥ 2\n",
    "* **Levels**: Each factor has ≥ 2 (independent or dependent)\n",
    "* Example: Running data + Gender\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Factor 1 = Running (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3 → dependent levels)\n",
    "  * Factor 2 = Gender (Male, Female → independent levels)\n",

    "\n",

    "✅ **Key Idea:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **One-Way ANOVA** → One factor, independent levels\n",
    "* **Repeated Measures ANOVA** → One factor, dependent levels\n",
