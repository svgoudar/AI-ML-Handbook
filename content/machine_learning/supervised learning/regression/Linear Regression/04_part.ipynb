    "## Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial Regression is an extension of **Linear Regression** where instead of fitting a straight line, we fit a **curved line (polynomial curve)** to capture **non-linear relationships** between the independent variable(s) and the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ While Linear Regression assumes the relationship is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial Regression allows higher-degree terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2 + \\beta_3 x^3 + \\dots + \\beta_d x^d + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $d$ = degree of polynomial (2 for quadratic, 3 for cubic, etc.)\n",
    "* The higher the degree, the more flexible (but also more prone to overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "* Imagine your dataset looks like a **curve (U-shape, S-shape, wave-like)**.\n",
    "* A straight line (Linear Regression) cannot capture this curvature well ‚Üí it will have **large errors**.\n",
    "* Polynomial Regression **adds powers of x** ($x^2, x^3, ...$) as extra features, allowing the model to bend and better follow the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as **Linear Regression on transformed features**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X = [1, x, x^2, x^3, ..., x^d]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Perform Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare data** (independent variable $x$, target variable $y$).\n",
    "2. **Transform features** ‚Äì generate polynomial features (e.g., $x^2, x^3$).\n",
    "3. **Apply Linear Regression** on these new features.\n",
    "4. **Fit and evaluate** the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs how Polynomial Regression works compared to Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Linear Regression (degree 1):** Straight line\n",
    "* **Polynomial Regression (degree 2 or higher):** Curve fits the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "üìä Imagine points shaped like a parabola (U-shaped).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linear Regression ‚Üí draws a straight line (bad fit).\n",
    "* Polynomial Regression (degree 2) ‚Üí draws a U-shape curve (good fit).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Can model non-linear relationships\n",
    "‚úÖ Easy to implement (just transform features, then use Linear Regression)\n",
    "‚úÖ Often improves accuracy over simple linear models\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Higher-degree polynomials ‚Üí risk of **overfitting**\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Becomes computationally expensive as degree grows\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Extrapolation (predicting outside data range) is very unreliable\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###Example (Quadratic Regression)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose house prices grow with square footage but with a curve (diminishing returns).\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation could look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Price = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot Size + \\beta_2 \\cdot Size^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Small homes ‚Üí price grows fast\n",
    "* Large homes ‚Üí price growth slows down\n",
    "* A quadratic curve captures this better than a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "üìå Would you like me to **generate Python code with plots** to show:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear Regression line (bad fit)\n",
    "2. Polynomial Regression curves (degree 2, degree 3) for the same dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "That way you‚Äôll see how the curve improves as degree increases.\n"
