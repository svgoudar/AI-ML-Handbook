    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of investigating and visualizing data to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions before applying statistical models or machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key goals of EDA include:\n",
    "- Understanding the structure and main characteristics of the data\n",
    "- Detecting outliers, missing values, and errors\n",
    "- Summarizing distributions and relationships between variables\n",
    "- Guiding further analysis and feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA is a crucial first step in any data science or analytics project, helping you make informed decisions and avoid common pitfalls."
