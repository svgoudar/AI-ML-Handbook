    "\n",
    "- **Combining and Relating Events**\n",
    "\n",
    "These rules are the bedrock for calculating probabilities of complex events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addition Rule (for \"OR\" events - Union of Events)\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule helps calculate the probability that at least one of two (or more) events occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mutually Exclusive Events (Disjoint Events):** Events that cannot occur at the same time. Their intersection is empty.\n",
    "    * *Formal Definition:* $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$\n",
    "    * *Formula:* $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$\n",
    "    * *Deeper Example:* In a deck of cards, drawing a King (Event A) and drawing a Queen (Event B) are mutually exclusive. You cannot draw a card that is both a King and a Queen.\n",
    "        $P(\\text{King or Queen}) = P(\\text{King}) + P(\\text{Queen}) = \\frac{4}{52} + \\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{8}{52} = \\frac{2}{13}$\n",

    "    * *Formula:* $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$\n",
    "        * The subtraction of $P(A \\cap B)$ is crucial to avoid double-counting the outcomes that are common to both A and B.\n",
    "    * *Deeper Example:* What is the probability of drawing a face card (Jack, Queen, King) OR a heart from a standard deck?\n",
    "        * Event A: Drawing a Face Card. There are 12 face cards (3 per suit). $P(A) = \\frac{12}{52}$\n",

    "        * Event $A \\cap B$: Drawing a face card *and* a heart. These are the King of Hearts, Queen of Hearts, Jack of Hearts. There are 3 such cards. $P(A \\cap B) = \\frac{3}{52}$\n",
    "        * $P(\\text{Face Card or Heart}) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) = \\frac{12}{52} + \\frac{13}{52} - \\frac{3}{52} = \\frac{25 - 3}{52} = \\frac{22}{52} = \\frac{11}{26}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiplication Rule \n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"AND\" events - Intersection of Events**\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule calculates the probability that two or more events all occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Independent Events:** The occurrence of one event does not influence the probability of the other event occurring.\n",
    "    * *Formal Definition:* $P(B|A) = P(B)$ (The probability of B given A is just the probability of B).\n",
    "    * *Formula:* $P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B)$\n",
    "    * *Deeper Example:* Rolling a die and flipping a coin. What is the probability of rolling a 6 AND getting a Head?\n",
    "        * $P(\\text{6}) = \\frac{1}{6}$\n",
    "        * $P(\\text{Head}) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n",
    "        * These events are independent.\n",
    "        * $P(\\text{6 and Head}) = P(\\text{6}) \\times P(\\text{Head}) = \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{12}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dependent Events:** The occurrence of one event *does* affect the probability of the other event occurring.\n",
    "    * *Formula:* $P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B|A)$\n",
    "        * This can be extended for more than two events: $P(A \\cap B \\cap C) = P(A) \\times P(B|A) \\times P(C|A \\cap B)$\n",
    "    * *Deeper Example:* Drawing two cards *without replacement* from a deck. What is the probability of drawing two Queens?\n",

    "        * Event B: Drawing a Queen on the second draw *given* the first was a Queen and not replaced.\n",
    "        * After the first Queen is drawn, there are 3 Queens left and 51 total cards.\n",
    "        * $P(B|A) = \\frac{3}{51}$\n",
    "        * $P(\\text{Queen and Queen}) = P(A) \\times P(B|A) = \\frac{4}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51} = \\frac{12}{2652} = \\frac{1}{221}$\n",

    "### Conditional Probability\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Probability Under New Information**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a critical concept that quantifies how the probability of an event changes when we know that another event has already occurred. It narrows down the sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Formula:** $P(B|A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)}$\n",
    "    * The \"condition\" is that event A has already happened. We are now considering only the outcomes within A.\n",
    "    * $P(A \\cap B)$ represents the outcomes where *both* A and B occur.\n",
    "    * $P(A)$ normalizes this by the size of the new (reduced) sample space (event A).\n",
    "* **Intuition:** Imagine you're looking at a subset of your original sample space. $P(B|A)$ tells you the proportion of that subset where B also occurs.\n",
    "* **Deeper Example:** A group of 100 students: 60 study Math, 40 study Science, and 20 study both.\n",
    "    * $P(\\text{Math}) = 60/100 = 0.6$\n",
    "    * $P(\\text{Science}) = 40/100 = 0.4$\n",
    "    * $P(\\text{Math and Science}) = 20/100 = 0.2$\n",
    "    * What is the probability that a student studies Science GIVEN that they study Math? ($P(\\text{Science}|\\text{Math})$)\n",
    "        * We are now only considering the 60 students who study Math. Of those 60, 20 also study Science.\n",
    "        * Using the formula: $P(\\text{Science}|\\text{Math}) = \\frac{P(\\text{Math and Science})}{P(\\text{Math})} = \\frac{0.2}{0.6} = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333$\n",
    "        * This makes sense: among the 60 math students, 20 also do science. $20/60 = 1/3$.\n",

    "### Bayesâ€™ Theorem \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Updating Beliefs with Evidence**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Bayes' Theorem is a cornerstone of inferential statistics and machine learning. It provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis (event A) when new evidence (event B) becomes available. It's about reversing conditional probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Formula:** $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\times P(A)}{P(B)}$\n",
    "    * $P(A|B)$: **Posterior Probability** - The probability of our hypothesis (A) being true, given the new evidence (B). This is what we want to find.\n",
    "    * $P(B|A)$: **Likelihood** - The probability of observing the evidence (B) if our hypothesis (A) were true. This comes from our model or knowledge.\n",
    "    * $P(A)$: **Prior Probability** - Our initial belief about the probability of the hypothesis (A) being true, *before* observing the new evidence.\n",
    "    * $P(B)$: **Marginal Probability of Evidence** - The total probability of observing the evidence (B), regardless of whether A is true or not. This acts as a normalizing constant. It can be expanded as:\n",
    "        $P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c)$ (where $A^c$ is the complement of A, i.e., A is false).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Power of Bayes' Theorem:** It's how we learn from data. We start with a prior belief, observe some data, and then use Bayes' Theorem to get a more informed posterior belief.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Deeper Example: Drug Testing**\n",
    "    * A drug test has a 99% true positive rate ($P(\\text{Positive}|\\text{User}) = 0.99$) and a 1% false positive rate ($P(\\text{Positive}|\\text{Non-User}) = 0.01$).\n",
    "    * 1% of the population uses the drug ($P(\\text{User}) = 0.01$).\n",
    "    * If someone tests positive, what is the probability they actually use the drug? ($P(\\text{User}|\\text{Positive})$)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Let $A = \\text{User}$ (has the drug)\n",
    "    * Let $B = \\text{Positive}$ (tests positive)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * We know:\n",
    "        * $P(A) = 0.01$ (Prior probability of being a user)\n",
    "        * $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 0.99$ (Prior probability of being a non-user)\n",
    "        * $P(B|A) = 0.99$ (Likelihood: probability of positive test given user)\n",
    "        * $P(B|A^c) = 0.01$ (Likelihood: probability of positive test given non-user - false positive)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * First, calculate $P(B)$ (Total probability of testing positive):\n",
    "        $P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c)$\n",
    "        $P(B) = (0.99)(0.01) + (0.01)(0.99) = 0.0099 + 0.0099 = 0.0198$\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:\n",
    "        $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\times P(A)}{P(B)} = \\frac{0.99 \\times 0.01}{0.0198} = \\frac{0.0099}{0.0198} = 0.5$\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Interpretation:** Even with a positive test, there's only a 50% chance the person actually uses the drug! This counter-intuitive result highlights the importance of the prior probability ($P(A)$) and the false positive rate. Since drug use is rare (1%), a significant portion of positive tests come from false positives among the large non-user population.\n"
