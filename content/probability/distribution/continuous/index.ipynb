    "# Continuous Probability Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "A **continuous probability distribution** describes outcomes of a *continuous random variable* — one that can take **any value within an interval**.  \n",
    "Examples: height, weight, temperature, or time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key properties:  \n",
    "- The probability of any **exact value** is 0.  \n",
    "- Probabilities are defined over an **interval** using the **area under the curve** of the probability density function (PDF).  \n",
    "- The total area under the PDF equals **1**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Common continuous distributions include:\n",
    "- **Normal (Gaussian) Distribution** – bell-shaped, most widely used.  \n",
    "- **Exponential Distribution** – models waiting times between events.  \n",
    "- **Uniform Distribution** – equal probability across an interval.  \n",
    "- **Gamma Distribution** – models skewed data, often for waiting times.  \n",
    "- **Beta Distribution** – useful for proportions and probabilities.  \n",
    "- **Chi-Square & t-Distributions** – important in hypothesis testing.  \n",
