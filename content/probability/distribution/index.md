# Probability Distributions

Probability distributions describe how the values of a random variable are spread or distributed.  
They provide a mathematical framework to model uncertainty and make predictions.

Distributions are broadly classified into:

- **Discrete Probability Distributions** → For variables that take **countable outcomes** (e.g., coin toss, number of defects).  
- **Continuous Probability Distributions** → For variables that take **any value within an interval** (e.g., height, weight, time).
