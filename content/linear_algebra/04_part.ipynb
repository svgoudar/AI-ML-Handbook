    "1. **Data Representation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Datasets can be represented as matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Rows → records (students).\n",
    "     * Columns → features (math, physics, biology scores).\n",
    "   * Example: a dataset of 3 students × 3 subjects → $3 \\times 3$ matrix.\n",
    "   * Used in ML models since models work with numbers, not feature names.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Images in Computer Vision**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Images are stored as pixel values in matrices.\n",
    "   * Grayscale → values between 0 (black) and 255 (white).\n",
    "   * Example: a $3 \\times 3$ grayscale image → matrix of pixel intensities.\n",

    "   * Prediction equation: $y = m_1x_1 + m_2x_2 + c$.\n",
    "   * Can be represented as matrix multiplication: $y = M^T X + c$.\n",
    "   * Helps estimate coefficients efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **NLP (Text to Vectors)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Words/sentences converted into numerical vectors.\n",

    "   * Condition: matrices must have the **same dimensions**.\n",
    "   * Operation: add/subtract corresponding elements.\n",
    "   * Example: sales data from **Store A** and **Store B**, summing up product sales day-wise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scalar Multiplication**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Multiply **every element** of a matrix by a scalar value.\n",
    "   * Use Case: adjusting product prices or salaries for **inflation**.\n",
    "   * Example: multiplying a price matrix by **1.05** for 5% inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Matrix Multiplication**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Involves **dot product** of rows (first matrix) with columns (second matrix).\n",
    "   * Condition: If $A$ is $m \\times n$ and $B$ is $n \\times p$, result = $m \\times p$.\n",
    "   * Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "     * $B^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 7 & 8 \\\\ 9 & 10 \\\\ 11 & 12 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "     * Result $C = \\begin{bmatrix} 58 & 64 \\\\ 139 & 154 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "   * Used extensively in **machine learning and deep learning** for operations like **forward propagation** in neural networks.\n",

    "### Additional Concept Introduced\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transpose of a Matrix**: flipping rows ↔ columns, used to make multiplication possible when dimensions don’t align.\n",
